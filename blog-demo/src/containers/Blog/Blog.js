import React, { Component } from 'react'
// import axios from 'axios'
import './Blog.css'
import axios from '../../axios'

//% Axios is a package for easily managing http/ajax requests
//* componentDidMount() is a great place for attaching an http request
//* because it can be executed as a side-effect without resulting
//* in a React re-render before the request has completed.
//? axios has PROMISE objects built-in. Therefore, you can chain .then onto it

//! Handling errors locally within components is a best practice and makes sense
